I am a researcher and lecturer at Institut Teknologi dan Bisnis STIKOM Bali for 6 years. I really love data analytics, and I have been concerned about machine learning and data analytics for the last 3 years. I have been involved in several research and development projects on machine learning and data analytics.

## Current Projects:

**Rainfall Forecast**

This project forecast rainfall at International Airport I Gusti Ngurah Rai using three machine learning models which are, Deep Learning using Tensorflow and Gradient Boosted Tree using XGBoost and LightGBM. I also developed a web app using Streamlit framework that allow users experiment with the machine learning model. The project is part of Kedaireka project between **Institut Teknologi dan Bisnis STIKOM Bali** and **Meteorology and Geophysics Agency Denpasar Region (Badan Meteorologi dan Geofisika â€“ BMKG)** funded by **Ministry of Education, Culture, Research, and Technology (Kementerian Pendidikan, Kebudayaan, Riset, dan Teknologi) Republic of Indonesia**. 

**Traditional Balinese Dance Video Classification**

Research project to classify traditional Balinese dance video. This is a pilot project which only classify the dance basic movement. The project compared **VGG16+LSTM** model with **I3D model**.

**Aksara Bali**

Research project to classify Aksara Bali character from image using transfer learning and one-shot learning builds in Pytorch.
